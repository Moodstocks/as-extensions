# ASE (as-extensions)

## WARNING

This gem is officially unmaintained, deprecated and hated by its original
author.

It provides core extensions, methods and modules on top of ActiveSupport.
Using it makes some classes behave differently than what you are used to.
The Time and DateTime classes are especially concerned.

It was all a very bad idea. If you are using it in your code,
you should migrate away from it (and, IMHO, from ActiveSupport altogether).
If you need help doing this, please get in touch (with @catwell).
